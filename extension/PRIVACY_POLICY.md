# Tab Vault Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

## Overview

Tab Vault is a browser extension that helps you capture and organize web pages using AI-powered summarization and search. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## Data We Collect

When you use Tab Vault, the following data is collected **only when you explicitly capture a tab**:

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Page URL | To store and retrieve your captured pages |
| Page Title | To display and search your captures |
| Selected Text (if any) | To provide context for AI summarization |
| Favicon URL | To display page icons in your capture list |

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Browsing history
- Passwords or form data
- Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- Data from pages you don't explicitly capture
- Cookies or session data

## How Your Data Is Used

1. **Storage**: Captured page data is sent to your configured backend server and stored in a database
2. **AI Processing**: Page content is processed by AI services (OpenRouter/OpenAI) to generate summaries, categories, tags, and search embeddings
3. **Search**: Embeddings enable semantic search across your captures

## Data Storage & Security

- Data is stored on servers you configure (default: Railway-hosted backend)
- Data is transmitted over HTTPS
- No data is sold or shared with third parties
- AI providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI) process content per their privacy policies

## Your Rights

You can:
- Delete individual captures at any time
- Export your data
- Change or self-host the backend server
- Uninstall the extension to stop all data collection

## Third-Party Services
